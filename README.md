A simple renderer / raytracer project. I'm hoping to add more as it goes on.

It includes for now: 

-Sphere objects

-Various materials, including solid colour, metals and dielectrics

-Movable camera

-Camera settings including depth of field and field of view

Work based on the book "Raytracing in One Weekend" by  Peter Shirley, Trevor David Black and Steve Hollasch
