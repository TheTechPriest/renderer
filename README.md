A simple renderer / raytracer project. I'm hoping to add more as it goes on.

It includes for now: 

-Sphere objects

-Various materials, including solid colour, metals and dielectrics

-Movable camera

-Camera settings including depth of field and field of view

HOW TO USE: If you decide to compile this, simply pipe the resulding output to a text file with the .ppm extension. Any ppm viewer should be able to display your image from that file. Feel free to mess around in the main.

Work based on the book "Raytracing in One Weekend" by  Peter Shirley, Trevor David Black and Steve Hollasch
