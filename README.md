A simple renderer / raytracer project. I'm hoping to add more as it goes on.

It includes for now: 
\n-Sphere objects
\n-Various materials, including solid colour, metals and dielectrics.
\n-Movable camera
\n-Camera settings including depth of field and field of view.

Work based on the book "Raytracing in One Weekend" by  Peter Shirley, Trevor David Black and Steve Hollasch
